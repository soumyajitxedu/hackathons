AgroSentry: The AI Field Assistant üöúüåøüß†

Your Expert in the Field. No Internet Required.

AgroSentry is a product concept for the Google Gemma 3n Impact Challenge. It's a private, offline-first, multimodal AI field assistant for small-scale farmers. It leverages Gemma 3n's unique capabilities to provide instant, expert-level diagnostics and actionable advice for crop management, directly on a standard smartphone.

The Challenge: The Digital Divide in the Dirt

The majority of the world's farmers operate in areas with limited or no internet connectivity. They lack access to timely, expert advice, making them vulnerable to crop diseases, pests, and the effects of climate change. Delays in diagnosis can lead to significant crop loss, economic hardship, and ecological damage from the overuse of generic pesticides.

The Solution: On-Device Multimodal AI

AgroSentry places a powerful, fine-tuned Gemma 3n model directly into the hands of farmers. By running entirely on-device, it bypasses the need for an internet connection, providing invaluable support in the most remote locations.

Gemma 3n Capability	AgroSentry Feature & Farmer Benefit
üåç Offline-First & Private	Instant In-Field Analysis: The entire model runs on-device. All data (crop photos, farm notes) stays on the farmer's phone, ensuring total privacy and immediate results.
üëÅÔ∏è Vision Modality	Visual Crop Doctor: A farmer takes a photo of a sick plant. The model identifies the disease, pest, or nutrient deficiency with high accuracy.
üó£Ô∏è Audio Modality	Acoustic Monitoring: A farmer can record the sound of their field to detect pests (like locusts) or the sound of a tractor engine to get a preliminary fault diagnosis.
üìù Text Modality	Conversational Agronomist: After a visual diagnosis, the farmer can ask follow-up questions in natural language, like "What's the best organic treatment?" and receive a detailed, actionable plan.
‚öôÔ∏è Efficient & Fine-tunable	Hyper-Localization: The model can be affordably fine-tuned (using Unsloth on a single GPU) for specific regions, local crop varieties, and endemic pests, dramatically improving its relevance and accuracy.
üõ†Ô∏è Core Technology Stack

Foundation Model: Google Gemma 3n (e.g., gemma-3n-2b-it) for its powerful, lightweight, and multimodal capabilities.

Fine-Tuning Framework: Unsloth for 2x faster, memory-efficient fine-tuning of Gemma 3n on accessible hardware (like a free Kaggle or Colab T4 GPU).

Core Libraries: PyTorch, Hugging Face transformers, peft, and trl.

Deployment Format: GGUF, to package the model for efficient inference on mobile CPUs/GPUs via llama.cpp.

üöÄ Getting Started & Running the Code

The code in this repository is provided as a demonstration notebook, showcasing the end-to-end process from loading the base model to fine-tuning and saving it for deployment.

1. Prerequisites

A CUDA-enabled GPU. The code is optimized for a Google Kaggle/Colab Tesla T4 instance.

Python 3.9+

Git

2. Setup

You can run this project directly on Kaggle or Google Colab.

Open the Notebook:

Select GPU: In the runtime settings, ensure a T4 GPU is selected.

Run All Cells: Press "Runtime" -> "Run all".

3. Code Walkthrough

The notebook demonstrates the key steps to building the AgroSentry AI:

Installation & Setup: Installs unsloth, transformers, and other dependencies.

Load Base Model: Loads a 4-bit quantized Gemma 3n model using unsloth.FastModel to conserve memory.

Generated python
from unsloth import FastModel
model, tokenizer = FastModel.from_pretrained(
    model_name = "unsloth/gemma-3n-E2B-it-unsloth-bnb-4bit",
    load_in_4bit = True,
)


Multimodal Inference (Pre-tuning): Shows how the base model can already process image, audio, and text inputs simultaneously.

Fine-Tuning Preparation:

Adds LoRA adapters to the model using FastModel.get_peft_model to enable efficient training.

Loads and formats a conversational dataset (for this demo, mlabonne/FineTome-100k) into the required gemma-3 chat template.

Train the Model: Uses the Hugging Face SFTTrainer to fine-tune the model on the new data. Unsloth's optimizations significantly speed up this process.

Generated python
from trl import SFTTrainer, SFTConfig
trainer = SFTTrainer(...)
trainer.train()

Inference (Post-tuning): Demonstrates how the fine-tuned model provides more specialized and accurate responses.

Saving for Deployment: Shows how to save the trained model adapters and, most importantly, how to convert it to GGUF format for mobile deployment.

Generated python
# Save the fine-tuned model for deployment
model.save_pretrained_gguf(
    "agrosentry-v1",
    quantization_type = "Q8_0",
